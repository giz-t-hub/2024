Market Power and the Energy Transition in the Global Oil Market </b> Charlotte De Cannière, November 2024: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUcyAJij-UZWJKVtANOwPNJ1T6PYrnP-/view - *This paper explores the interaction between market power and the energy transition in the global upstream oil industry. To align with the Paris Agreement’s global warming target, a significant portion of world oil reserves needs to remain untapped. At the same time, the OPEC cartel in the global crude oil market exercises market power by strategically slowing down production to inflate prices. Using detailed micro-level data on global oil production, costs and reserves, it builds and estimates a dynamic structural model of global oil production in a cartel-fringe setting.*
- <b> The contribution of ports to shipping decarbonization: An analysis of port incentive programmes and the executive role of port state control </b> Peyman Ghaforian Masodzadeh, Aykut I. Ölçer, Fabio Ballini, Dimitrios Dalaklis, November 2024: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949899624000145?via%3Dihub - *This study aims to analyse the role of ports in shipping decarbonization by conducting an online survey and interviewing experts. It examines two proposals: first, a global incentive scheme focused solely on CO2 reduction, supported by the GHG Fund of the future IMO carbon pricing mechanism, acting as a rebate mechanism, and second, a voyage-based data collection and verification system. Experts have strongly supported the first proposal. The second proposal is technically feasible, since some verification firms and pioneer shipping companies have already started this practice. It is economically also feasible at a minor cost. A differentiated bunker levy based on these proposals is recommended at the end, in which ports play a significant role.*
- <b> Assessing contributions of passenger groups to public transportation crowding </b> Anastasios Skoufas, Matej Cebecauer, Wilco Burghout, Erik Jenelius, Oded Cats, November 2024: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077291X24000304 - *On-board crowding in public transportation has a significant impact on passengers' travel experience. However, there is little knowledge of how different passenger groups contribute to on-board crowding. Empirical knowledge of specific passenger groups' impact on the system facilitates more effective tuning of policy instruments such as new fare structures, dedicated public transportation services, infrastructure investments, and capacity provision. For Stockholm, findings indicate that school students and passengers traversing the inner city have similar crowding contributions, utilizing 15 % and 11 % of the seating capacity across all modes during the AM and the PM peak, respectively.*

Part two evaluates the economic, environmental, and social impacts on companies, citizens, and cities. By integrating automated vehicles into Mobility-as-a-Service and Intelligent Transport Systems, the book argues for the using of automated vehicles as game changer towards a transformative shift to sustainable, citizen-centric mobility. It advocates for efficiency, flexibility, and resilience of the transport system without imposing coercive transformation policies.*
- <b> The role of supply-side regulations in meeting Indonesia’s 2030 electric vehicle target </b> Dale Hall, Francisco Posada, Jeanly Syahputri, Josh Miller, and Zifei Yang / ICCT, July 2024: https://theicct.org/publication/role-of-supply-side-regulations-in-meeting-indonesias-2030-ev-target-jul24/ - *Indonesia aims to have 2 million electric vehicles (EVs) on its roads by 2030. The projections in this brief suggest that, even with continued fiscal incentives such as the reduced Value Added Tax for qualifying EVs, EVs will only account for 12%–18% of new car sales by 2030, short of the target. To meet the target, sales of EVs must grow much faster and reach about 49% of new cars by 2030. The authors analyze how two options for supply-side regulations—fuel consumption standards and EV sales requirements—could help accelerate the EV transition in line with Indonesia’s goals. Both regulations have proven effective in other major markets and at almost no cost to the national budget (the only costs are monitoring and enforcement). Although this paper focuses on passenger cars, these types of supply-side policies can be designed and implemented for two-wheelers, light commercial vehicles, and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.*

Blair Matthew Turner, Alina Florentina Burlacu, Chris Jurewicz, July 2024: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666691X24000344#tbl0001 - *Road traffic crashes and fatalities pose a significant global challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where a major cause is consistently linked to speeding (i.e., excessive or inappropriate speeds). However, the existing body of evidence regarding the estimated contribution of speeding to crashes and fatalities, remains limited and is considered outdated. This paper bridges this knowledge gap by reviewing evidence on the contribution of speeding to crashes and fatalities. The review draws on a wide range of sources including peer-reviewed studies on the subject, road safety monitoring-reports and available data summaries (104 sources).*
- <b> The illusion of the shared electric automated mobility transition </b> Dimitris Milakis, Dennis Seibert, July 2024: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259019822400157X - *The analysis reveals that shared, particularly pooled, mobility emerges slowly (niche level). Key actors resist a shift from private to shared electric automated mobility for economic (vehicle manufacturers), instrumental, affective, symbolic (users and societal groups), tax-revenue, governance and administrative (public authorities) reasons (regime level). The private automobility regime receives only moderate pressure from the socio-technical landscape pertaining to safety, congestion and environmental issues and effectively reacts by electrifying and automating vehicles (landscape level). It onclude that the most likely transition will primarily entail privately-owned electric AVs as opposed to shared (especially pooled) AVs, unless a landscape “shock” such as a climate breakdown, energy crisis or a significant political shift towards collective mobility exerts substantial pressure on the regime.*

Here we quantify the impact of this measure in economic and environmental terms. The results show that although this measure goes in the right direction, it is less effective than expected in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from domestic aviation. The adoption of the measure is less ambitious than originally envisaged, and it crucially leaves important domestic air routes out of the ban. As data shows, there is a substitution effect between routes that do not meet the objective of reducing flights and therefore GHG emissions. Moreover, alternative scenarios to the one currently approved have been presented and examined, both in terms of potential extension of routes banned and in substitution effects. Thus, the results show that with this minor modification of the currently approved measure, the substitution effects are removed, and the currently reduced emissions are more than tripled.*

However, questions persist regarding the extent to which e-bikes contribute to replacing and complementing car use and other modes, especially from dual-mode ownership (households with both cars and e-bikes) perspective. Utilizing the Household Travel Survey dataset from Jiading, Shanghai, this study reveals that: (1) e-bikes can lead up to a 19% reduction in car mode share in dual-mode ownership households compared to car-only households; (2) e-bikes encourage a greater variety of non-commuting activities compared to car-only households; (3) e-bikes have a minor negative effect on public transport mode share, while e-bikes enhance mobility for older people. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of e-bikes in reducing car dependence and achieving development goals towards sustainable transportation and age-friendly cities.*

- <b> Ten Thousand Steps in Her Shoes: The Role of Public Transport in Women’s Economic Empowerment </b> World Bank, Julne 2024: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/93ebbd94-956a-4cfd-8965-e2d791ddef8b - *Although public transport systems can play a significant role in women’s participation in the labor force globally, this topic has been little explored in the MENA region. This report examines the role of public transport in women’s access to economic opportunities in urban MENA. The book studies the links among mobility, gender, and access to economic opportunities and focuses on three metropolitan areas—Amman, Jordan; Beirut, Lebanon; and Cairo, the Arab Republic of Egypt. Chapters focus on the availability of public transport close to households and employment centers, accessibility to job opportunities, affordability, social and cultural norms, and safety from crime and harassment. Data collected in 2022 reveal that a significant percentage of non-working women in urban MENA lack affordable, comfortable, safe, time-efficient, and reliable transport options, thus preventing them from seeking work. Women can contribute significantly to the economy.*

- <b> Potenziale des Radverkehrs für den Klimaschutz und für lebenswerte Städte und Regionen - Neue Prognoseverfahren für Angebot und Nachfrage im Fahrradland 
Deutschland bis 2035 - Langfassung </b> *(The potential of cycling for climate protection and livable urban centers and regions - New methods for forecasting supply and demand in Germany as a cycling nation up to 2035)*, Fraunhofer ISI: https://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/de/blog/2024/adfc-radverkehrsanteil-potenzialabschaetzungen.html, EN Summary: https://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/isi/dokumente/ccn/2024/2024-05_adfc_cycling_potentials_germany_summary.pdf - *If all three building blocks of "Cycling in Germany" were consistently implemented, an additional annual saving of 19 million tonnes of CO2e would be achieved compared to the current transport policy or 15 per cent of greenhouse gases in land-based passenger transport as a whole (including all journeys over 30 kilometres).*
- <b> Mind the Gap: A Comparative Study of Low-Car Policy Acceptance </b>, Anastasia Roukouni, Oded Cats, May 2024: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4831659 - *The introduction or even consideration of low-car interventions may spark a heated debate amongst residents as well as between local authorities and residents. We investigate residents’ and stakeholders’ views towards different types of low-car city interventions, using Amsterdam as a case study. The study compiles a list of 28 low-car measures and identify the most and least favorable measures. In particular, it conducts a comparative analysis thereby contrasting the residents’ own views, stakeholders’ own views as representatives of their organization and stakeholders’ expectations of the residents’ views. Exploratory factor analysis is employed as a data reduction technique, followed by the application of a latent class cluster analysis, which reveals three clusters of Amsterdam residents which can be broadly labelled as supporters, skeptics and the ones with mixed attitude towards the low-car concept. Moreover, the findings show that stakeholders tend to express more support than residents towards low-car policy interventions as well as often over-estimate residents’ support, highlighting the need for improving bi-directional communication.*
- <b> Build it and they will come? The effects of a new infrastructure on cycling practices and experiences </b>, Patrick Rérat, 
Aurélie Schmassmann, May 2024: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198224001076 - *What are the effects of cycling infrastructure? This question is crucial as cities begin to give more space to cycling. In this paper uses the theoretical concept of affordance to consider not only what a cycle lane affords (or enables), but also how it does this and for whom. This has led us to consider three dimensions: (1) the number of cyclists using a route, (2) their characteristics and (3) their experience of cycling. It adopts an approach that combines counting, observation, and intercept surveys both before and then one year after the installation of a new 1.1 km cycle lane in Fribourg, Switzerland.*

The systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results from 40 different cities across Europe, including Brussels, Paris, and Zurich, indicated that reductions in speed limits improved road safety by decreasing the likelihood of crash risk and the severity of crashes that do occur. On average, the implementation of 30 km/h speed limits in European cities demonstrated a 23%, 37%, and 38% reduction in road crashes, fatalities, and injuries, respectively. Lower speed limits also yielded environmental benefits, with emissions decreasing on average by 18%, noise pollution levels by 2.5 dB, and fuel consumption by 7%, indicating enhanced fuel efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Encouraging citizens to embrace walking, cycling and utilizing public transit services can further contribute to a safer and environmentally sustainable urban environment.*
