The projections in this brief suggest that, even with continued fiscal incentives such as the reduced Value Added Tax for qualifying EVs, EVs will only account for 12%–18% of new car sales by 2030, short of the target. To meet the target, sales of EVs must grow much faster and reach about 49% of new cars by 2030. The authors analyze how two options for supply-side regulations—fuel consumption standards and EV sales requirements—could help accelerate the EV transition in line with Indonesia’s goals. Both regulations have proven effective in other major markets and at almost no cost to the national budget (the only costs are monitoring and enforcement). Although this paper focuses on passenger cars, these types of supply-side policies can be designed and implemented for two-wheelers, light commercial vehicles, and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.*

Key actors resist a shift from private to shared electric automated mobility for economic (vehicle manufacturers), instrumental, affective, symbolic (users and societal groups), tax-revenue, governance and administrative (public authorities) reasons (regime level). The private automobility regime receives only moderate pressure from the socio-technical landscape pertaining to safety, congestion and environmental issues and effectively reacts by electrifying and automating vehicles (landscape level). It onclude that the most likely transition will primarily entail privately-owned electric AVs as opposed to shared (especially pooled) AVs, unless a landscape “shock” such as a climate breakdown, energy crisis or a significant political shift towards collective mobility exerts substantial pressure on the regime.*

Here we quantify the impact of this measure in economic and environmental terms. The results show that although this measure goes in the right direction, it is less effective than expected in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from domestic aviation. The adoption of the measure is less ambitious than originally envisaged, and it crucially leaves important domestic air routes out of the ban. As data shows, there is a substitution effect between routes that do not meet the objective of reducing flights and therefore GHG emissions. Moreover, alternative scenarios to the one currently approved have been presented and examined, both in terms of potential extension of routes banned and in substitution effects. Thus, the results show that with this minor modification of the currently approved measure, the substitution effects are removed, and the currently reduced emissions are more than tripled.*

However, questions persist regarding the extent to which e-bikes contribute to replacing and complementing car use and other modes, especially from dual-mode ownership (households with both cars and e-bikes) perspective. Utilizing the Household Travel Survey dataset from Jiading, Shanghai, this study reveals that: (1) e-bikes can lead up to a 19% reduction in car mode share in dual-mode ownership households compared to car-only households; (2) e-bikes encourage a greater variety of non-commuting activities compared to car-only households; (3) e-bikes have a minor negative effect on public transport mode share, while e-bikes enhance mobility for older people. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of e-bikes in reducing car dependence and achieving development goals towards sustainable transportation and age-friendly cities.*

- <b> Mind the Gap: A Comparative Study of Low-Car Policy Acceptance </b>, Anastasia Roukouni, Oded Cats, May 2024: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4831659 - *The introduction or even consideration of low-car interventions may spark a heated debate amongst residents as well as between local authorities and residents. We investigate residents’ and stakeholders’ views towards different types of low-car city interventions, using Amsterdam as a case study. The study compiles a list of 28 low-car measures and identify the most and least favorable measures. In particular, it conducts a comparative analysis thereby contrasting the residents’ own views, stakeholders’ own views as representatives of their organization and stakeholders’ expectations of the residents’ views. Exploratory factor analysis is employed as a data reduction technique, followed by the application of a latent class cluster analysis, which reveals three clusters of Amsterdam residents which can be broadly labelled as supporters, skeptics and the ones with mixed attitude towards the low-car concept. Moreover, the findings show that stakeholders tend to express more support than residents towards low-car policy interventions as well as often over-estimate residents’ support, highlighting the need for improving bi-directional communication.*
