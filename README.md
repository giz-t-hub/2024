    - <b> Street Experiments as Transformative Planning Tools: Contrasting Adaptive Approaches towards Urban Livability and Sustainable Urban Mobility </b>, Lukas Hügle, July 2023: https://hlbrm.pur.hebis.de/xmlui/handle/123456789/183 - *This thesis explores how municipalities can use street experiments to enhance urban livability and sustainable mobility. It identifies two key strategies: temporary street use actions for spatial flexibility and phase 0 actions for permanent reconstruction. Thematic types include street events, periodic pop-ups, interim uses, and various planning actions. Case studies in Berlin, Malmö, and Hackney reveal the evolving roles of municipal planners. Effective adaptive planning needs strategic frameworks, clear objectives, preparation, engagement strategies, and evaluations. The thesis highlights the importance of understanding who benefits from these experiments and calls for further research on their social impacts.*
