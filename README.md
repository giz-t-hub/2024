- <b> The contribution of excessive or inappropriate speeds to road traffic crashes and fatalities: A review of literature </b>: Stephen Kome Fondzenyuy, 
Blair Matthew Turner, Alina Florentina Burlacu, Chris Jurewicz, July 2024: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666691X24000344#tbl0001 - *Road traffic crashes and fatalities pose a significant global challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where a major cause is consistently linked to speeding (i.e., excessive or inappropriate speeds). However, the existing body of evidence regarding the estimated contribution of speeding to crashes and fatalities, remains limited and is considered outdated. This paper bridges this knowledge gap by reviewing evidence on the contribution of speeding to crashes and fatalities. The review draws on a wide range of sources including peer-reviewed studies on the subject, road safety monitoring-reports and available data summaries (104 sources).*
- <b> The illusion of the shared electric automated mobility transition </b> Dimitris Milakis, Dennis Seibert, July 2024: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259019822400157X - *The analysis reveals that shared, particularly pooled, mobility emerges slowly (niche level). Key actors resist a shift from private to shared electric automated mobility for economic (vehicle manufacturers), instrumental, affective, symbolic (users and societal groups), tax-revenue, governance and administrative (public authorities) reasons (regime level). The private automobility regime receives only moderate pressure from the socio-technical landscape pertaining to safety, congestion and environmental issues and effectively reacts by electrifying and automating vehicles (landscape level). It onclude that the most likely transition will primarily entail privately-owned electric AVs as opposed to shared (especially pooled) AVs, unless a landscape “shock” such as a climate breakdown, energy crisis or a significant political shift towards collective mobility exerts substantial pressure on the regime.*

- <b> Connectivity, Road Quality, and Jobs : Evidence from Armenia </b>: Nino Pkhikidze / World Bank, July 2024: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099439407102418802/idu162e4ac57105bb14438185e3120f86105af03 - *Good road infrastructure decreases travel time and improves accessibility to urban areas. Improved rural-urban linkages could also affect rural employment through decreased time and travel costs. To study this link, the paper analyzes the impact of good quality roads on agricultural and non-agricultural jobs in Armenia, using different sets of data and different methodological approaches. The results show that a shorter 
distance to a good quality road has a statistically significant positive impact on overall non-agricultural employment for men and women, increasing the likelihood of cash-earning jobs for rural women and skilled manual and non-seasonal employment for rural men.*

- <b> Creating a public realm for all </b>, Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT), July 2024: https://www.ciht.org.uk/media/yfthfxfy/creating-a-public-realm-090724.pdf - *The report highlights some of the barriers that people face when using the public realm and suggests guidance documents that could be used to help design solutions to the issues experienced. A key feature of the report is the importance of “co-cultivation” (i.e. continuous, meaningful engagement and representation from inception and design through construction, operation, and monitoring to re-evaluation) rather than light-touch consultation on a public realm scheme. This should result in a shared understanding of the issues faced (from both the user and the designer perspective) and increased commitment to finding appropriate solutions.*
- <b> What should the new Government do about Roads and Traffic? A Strategy for Truth and Reconciliation </b>, Phil Goodwin, July 2024: https://tapas.network/60/goodwin.php - *The new Labour administration is faced with making a challenging set of decisions about controversial highway schemes inherited from the previous Government, and setting out a wider framework of future roads and traffic policy, which it didn’t do before the Election. Phil Goodwin argues that a long hard look at the legacy position and establishment of clear set of objectives is needed to anchor decisions going forward. He suggests the establishment of thoughtful and inclusive independent review would really help that process*
- <b> Short-haul flights ban in France: Relevant potential but yet modest effects of GHG emissions reduction </b>, Andoni Txapartegi, Ignacio Cazcarro, Ibon Galarraga, July 2024: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800924001861?via%3Dihub - *The French government has taken a new measure of limiting the exercise of traffic rights to reduce emissions, in particular, the bill to ban short-haul flights where a train alternative of 2:30 h or less exists. Here we quantify the impact of this measure in economic and environmental terms. The results show that although this measure goes in the right direction, it is less effective than expected in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from domestic aviation. The adoption of the measure is less ambitious than originally envisaged, and it crucially leaves important domestic air routes out of the ban. As data shows, there is a substitution effect between routes that do not meet the objective of reducing flights and therefore GHG emissions. Moreover, alternative scenarios to the one currently approved have been presented and examined, both in terms of potential extension of routes banned and in substitution effects. Thus, the results show that with this minor modification of the currently approved measure, the substitution effects are removed, and the currently reduced emissions are more than tripled.*
- <b> How electric bikes reduce car use: A dual-mode ownership perspective </b>, Ailing Yin, Xiaohong Chen, Frauke Behrendt, Andrew Morris, Xiang Liu, July 2024: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S136192092400261X?via%3Dihub - *Electric bikes (e-bikes) can play a vital role in sustainable transportation and reducing car dependence. However, questions persist regarding the extent to which e-bikes contribute to replacing and complementing car use and other modes, especially from dual-mode ownership (households with both cars and e-bikes) perspective. Utilizing the Household Travel Survey dataset from Jiading, Shanghai, this study reveals that: (1) e-bikes can lead up to a 19% reduction in car mode share in dual-mode ownership households compared to car-only households; (2) e-bikes encourage a greater variety of non-commuting activities compared to car-only households; (3) e-bikes have a minor negative effect on public transport mode share, while e-bikes enhance mobility for older people. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of e-bikes in reducing car dependence and achieving development goals towards sustainable transportation and age-friendly cities.*

- <b> Review of City-Wide 30 km/h Speed Limit Benefits in Europe </b>: Department of Transportation Planning and Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, May 2024: https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/11/4382 - *This study described the changes in safety, environment, energy, traffic, livability, and health before and after the phased implementation of city-wide 30 km/h speed limits. The systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results from 40 different cities across Europe, including Brussels, Paris, and Zurich, indicated that reductions in speed limits improved road safety by decreasing the likelihood of crash risk and the severity of crashes that do occur. On average, the implementation of 30 km/h speed limits in European cities demonstrated a 23%, 37%, and 38% reduction in road crashes, fatalities, and injuries, respectively. Lower speed limits also yielded environmental benefits, with emissions decreasing on average by 18%, noise pollution levels by 2.5 dB, and fuel consumption by 7%, indicating enhanced fuel efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Encouraging citizens to embrace walking, cycling and utilizing public transit services can further contribute to a safer and environmentally sustainable urban environment.*
